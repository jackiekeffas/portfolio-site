						<p>I got my start studying photography and video production at Northeastern University, where I earned my BFA in Digital Art with a minor in Film Production.</p>
						<p>I currently work as a Marketing Designer at K Health, and, before that, spent years as a designer and developer for Pretty Instant, working with clients such as Disney, Porsche, and LinkedIn.</p>
						<p>When I’m not moving pixels around, you can usually find me behind a camera, flipping through record bins, or watching teen dramas from the 2000s.</p>
						<p>I'm always looking for new opportunities, so <a href="mailto:jkeffas@gmail.com" target="_blank">let's chat</a>!</p>
