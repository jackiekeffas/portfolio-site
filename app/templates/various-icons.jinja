            <p class="small subtle">An end-to-end managed photography platform that handled logistics, staffing, editing, and delivery of photos for clients, and offered experiential, roaming photo booth activations.</p>
            <p>When I started working as a designer for Pretty Instant, icons were a big part of the branding. A set existed that outlined the booking process, but I often found myself needing more. I designed additional icons based off the black and white style to represent shoot types and help illustrate how Pretty Instant is better than its competitors.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the icons and using some of them, I also created badges to showcase Pretty Instant's client commitments and high Net Promoter Score.</p>

            <p class="small subtle">A portfolio web app designed to enhance professional communication within the entertainment industry by delivering curated and protected content to pitch a concise message with a single URL.</p>
            <p>During my time as an in-house designer for Presskit.to, I created a variety of icons and illustrations for things such as the user support Twitter, website, and store.</p>
            <p>The Twitter profile image I made featured the Presskit.to logo placed inside a life saver with the company's signature blue coloring.</p>
            <p>For the website, I designed icons for each of the three primary account types—personal, business, and education—to quickly highlight who benefited from using the platform.</p>
            <p>Along with its app, Presskit.to offered press kit management and white label design services, purchasable through a web store. Since the services weren't tangible products, I created illustrations to represent them in the shop.</p>
