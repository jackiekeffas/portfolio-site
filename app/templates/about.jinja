						<p>I'm currently working as a UI/visual designer at The College Board, building products for students to help them figure out a college or post-high-school plan. Before that, I was the brand and marketing designer at K Health, where I was responsible for developing and maintaining the K Health brand identity across all platforms. </p>
						<p>My experience extends beyond design, having previously worked as a front-end developer, and includes a background in photography and video production.</p>
						<p>You can usually find me <a href="/photo" class="inline light">behind a camera</a>, watching horror movies, or flipping through record bins.</p>
						<p>I'm always open to new opportunities, so <a class="inline light" href="mailto:jkeffas@gmail.com" target="_blank">let's chat</a>!</p>
